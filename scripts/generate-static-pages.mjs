Chicago Fleet Wraps offers same-day installation for partial wraps, vinyl lettering, spot graphics, and select color change wraps.

Not every wrap takes 3–5 days. Our 1 day wrap service is designed for businesses that cannot afford vehicle downtime. Partial wraps covering sides and rear, commercial lettering packages, and single-panel color accents can all be completed in one business day.

Our one day wrap options include:
• Partial commercial wraps (sides + rear) — installed in 4–6 hours
• Commercial vinyl lettering — company name, phone, DOT info — 2–4 hours
• Single-panel color change accents — hood, roof, or trunk — 3–5 hours
• Spot graphics and logo applications — 1–3 hours
• Fleet decal packages for multiple vehicles — 1–2 hours per vehicle

All one day wraps use the same premium Avery Dennison and 3M cast vinyl as our multi-day installations. No shortcuts, no calendered film. The difference is scope, not quality.

Pricing for 1 day wraps starts at $400 for lettering packages and $1,200–$2,500 for partial wraps. Full vehicle wraps require 2–5 days and cannot be rushed without compromising quality.

Free pickup and delivery throughout Chicagoland for all one day wrap projects. Drop off in the morning, pick up by end of day.` },

<h2>Why Chicago Fleet Wraps for ${escapeHtml(page.h1)}</h2>
<p>Since 2001, Chicago Fleet Wraps has built its reputation on one standard: cast vinyl only, applied right the first time. We use <strong>Avery Dennison MPI 1105</strong> and <strong>3M IJ180-CV3</strong> — the same materials Amazon DSP operators, regional distributors, and national brands rely on. No calendered shortcuts, no subcontractors, no exceptions.</p>
<p>With <strong>9,400+ vehicles wrapped</strong> and <strong>zero verified paint damage claims</strong> in 10+ years, our track record speaks for itself. Every project comes with a <strong>2-year workmanship warranty</strong> and free pickup and delivery throughout Chicagoland — Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Will, and McHenry Counties.</p>

<h2>Materials: Avery Dennison vs 3M</h2>
<p>Chicago Fleet Wraps uses two cast vinyl systems — both rated for <strong>5–7 years outdoor</strong> in Chicago's climate. We don't use calendered vinyl, economy films, or off-brand materials on any commercial job.</p>
<ul style="color:rgba(255,255,255,.72);line-height:2;padding-left:20px">
<li><strong>Avery Dennison MPI 1105</strong> — our primary fleet material. Conformable cast film for rivets, curves, and compound shapes. Consistent performance across all vehicle types.</li>
<li><strong>3M IJ180-CV3</strong> — premium cast vinyl with Comply air-release technology. Used on smooth surfaces and color change applications.</li>
<li><strong>DOL 1360 Overlaminate</strong> — gloss overlaminate applied to all prints. Adds UV protection and scratch resistance to extend wrap life.</li>
